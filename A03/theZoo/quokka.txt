Quokka's are little cuties that are around the size of a household cat. 
Some say this animal are the happiest animal in the world. They are located in
West Australia. Quokka's are super friendly and love to take excellent selfies.
Female quokka's with a baby have a unique attribute where if they are pursued 
by a predator, she may drop her baby onto the ground to escape. Aren't they so 
much fun!

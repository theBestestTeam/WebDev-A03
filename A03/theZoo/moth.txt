Moths are highly deceptive creatures capable of blending into their environments and breaking down bridges. They love lamps and eventually would like to become owners of their
own lamp in their homes one day. Moths come in all different shapes and sizes. They are 
the ugly cousin of the butterfly. However, there are the rare beautiful moths that are 
generally often mistaken for being a butterfly.

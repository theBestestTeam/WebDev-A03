Tigers are one of the largest and most efficient land predators on the
planet. Their razor sharp claws and fangs make them the ultimate killing
machine. Their propensity for violence is only matched by how
cool they look. In short, tiger's are awesome.

The only thing that can kill a tiger is Sam Rockwell.
